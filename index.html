        <li><strong>My thoughts on XXXTENTACION</strong>: 
            The first time I heard X's music, I felt like he wasn't make it as far as he did. However, 
        once I heard his debut album, <i>17</i>, I feel in love with his music. He introduced an unique way to combined
    different kinds of genres of music and make a story each song. He has songs that will relate with you if you suffer from 
mental illnesses, and he also has stuff that is just for hype and have you jump around. I heard about his past, and I believe that made him 
want to change because he finally mature and look at life a different way and started to give back to his fans and the community. 
Despite losing him at the peak of his career, he made impact in the rap music industry, introducing different genres and sounds into the rap industry. </li>
